4. **Self-Registration**: Allow participants to register themselves

## Question Types and Best Practices

### Multiple Choice Questions

**Best for**: Testing knowledge and understanding

**Tips:**
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Create plausible distractors
- Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above"
- Include explanations for correct answers

**Example:**
```
Question: What is the primary purpose of a database index?

A. To reduce storage space
B. To improve query performance
C. To ensure data integrity
D. To encrypt sensitive data

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Database indexes improve query performance by providing faster data access paths.
```

### Coding Questions

**Best for**: Testing programming skills and problem-solving

**Tips:**
- Provide clear problem statements
- Include comprehensive test cases
- Give appropriate starter code
- Consider multiple programming languages

**Example:**
```
Problem: Implement a function that finds the longest palindrome substring.

Requirements:
- Input: A string s
- Output: The longest palindromic substring
- Time complexity: O(n²) or better

Test Cases:
"babad" → "bab" or "aba"
"cbbd" → "bb"
"a" → "a"
```

### Essay Questions

**Best for**: Testing analytical thinking and communication

**Tips:**
- Provide clear rubrics
- Set appropriate word limits
- Give specific prompts
- Include evaluation criteria

**Example:**
```
Question: Explain the trade-offs between using a relational database versus a NoSQL database for a web application.

Requirements:
- Word limit: 300-500 words
- Include specific examples
- Discuss scalability considerations
- Mention use cases for each type

Rubric:
- Technical accuracy (40%)
- Clarity of explanation (30%)
- Quality of examples (20%)
- Grammar and structure (10%)
```

### Practical Tasks

**Best for**: Testing hands-on skills and real-world application

**Tips:**
- Provide clear project requirements
- Include success criteria
- Give appropriate time limits
- Consider file upload capabilities

## Assessment Design Principles

### Validity

Ensure your assessment measures what it's supposed to measure:

- **Content Validity**: Questions cover the intended topics
- **Construct Validity**: Assessment measures the intended skills
- **Criterion Validity**: Results correlate with real-world performance

### Reliability

Ensure consistent results across different administrations:

- **Question Quality**: Use well-tested questions
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide unambiguous directions
- **Consistent Scoring**: Use standardized scoring methods
- **Time Management**: Allow sufficient time for completion

### Fairness

Ensure equal opportunity for all participants:

- **Accessibility**: Accommodate different learning styles
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Avoid culturally biased content
- **Language Clarity**: Use clear, simple language
- **Reasonable Accommodations**: Provide necessary accommodations
