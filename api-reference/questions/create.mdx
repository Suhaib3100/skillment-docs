## Overview

Create custom questions tailored to your organization's specific needs and assessment requirements.

## Question Creation Process

### Step 1: Choose Question Type

Select from available question types:

- **Multiple Choice**: Traditional quiz questions
- **Coding**: Programming challenges with code execution
- **Essay**: Open-ended text responses
- **File Upload**: Submit documents or code files
- **Video Response**: Record video answers
- **Practical Task**: Hands-on project work

### Step 2: Basic Information

Fill in essential question details:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive question title
- **Question Text**: Main question content with formatting
- **Category**: Programming, Design, Business, etc.
- **Difficulty**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Estimated Time**: Time needed to complete (minutes)
- **Tags**: Skills, technologies, or concepts

### Step 3: Question Content

Add the specific question content based on type:

#### Multiple Choice Questions

```
Question: What is the output of console.log(typeof [])?

Options:
A. "object"
B. "array" 
C. "undefined"
D. "string"

Correct Answer: A
Explanation: In JavaScript, arrays are objects, so typeof [] returns "object"
```

#### Coding Questions

```
Problem: Write a function that reverses a string.

Starter Code:
function reverseString(str) {
    // Your code here
}

Test Cases:
reverseString("hello") → "olleh"
reverseString("world") → "dlrow"
reverseString("") → ""
```

#### Essay Questions

```
Question: Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming. 
Provide examples of when you would use each approach.

Word Limit: 200-500 words
Rubric: 
- Technical accuracy (40%)
- Clarity of explanation (30%)
- Quality of examples (30%)
```

### Step 4: Advanced Settings

Configure additional options:

- **Scoring**: Points value and partial credit rules
- **Time Limit**: Maximum time for this question
- **Randomization**: Shuffle answer options
- **Hints**: Provide helpful hints to participants
- **Feedback**: Custom feedback for correct/incorrect answers

### Step 5: Preview and Test

Before publishing:

1. **Preview Question**: See how it appears to participants
2. **Test Functionality**: Try answering the question yourself
3. **Validate Logic**: Ensure correct answers work properly
4. **Check Formatting**: Verify text and code display correctly

- **Word Limits**: Set appropriate length requirements
- **Prompts**: Give specific, actionable prompts
- **Examples**: Provide sample responses when helpful

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process

1. **Self-Review**: Check your own questions for errors
2. **Peer Review**: Have colleagues review questions
3. **Testing**: Test with sample participants
4. **Iteration**: Refine based on feedback

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Question is clear and unambiguous
- [ ] Correct answer is actually correct
- [ ] All options are plausible (for multiple choice)
- [ ] Time estimate is reasonable
- [ ] Difficulty level is appropriate
- [ ] Tags and categories are accurate

## Question Analytics

### Performance Tracking

Monitor question performance after use:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of correct answers
- **Average Time**: Time taken to complete
- **Difficulty Rating**: Participant-reported difficulty
- **Discrimination**: How well it differentiates performance

### Continuous Improvement

Use analytics to improve questions:

- **Identify Issues**: Find questions with low success rates
- **Refine Content**: Update unclear or problematic questions
- **Adjust Difficulty**: Modify difficulty based on performance
- **Add Variants**: Create variations of successful questions
