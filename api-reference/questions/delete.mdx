## Before You Delete

### Impact Assessment

Consider the impact of deletion:

- **Active Assessments**: Check if questions are used in active assessments
- **Historical Data**: Consider impact on historical results
- **Question Dependencies**: Check for related questions
- **Assessment Balance**: Ensure remaining questions provide good coverage

### Alternative Actions

Instead of deletion, consider:

- **Archive**: Move to archived questions list
- **Update**: Improve the question instead of deleting
- **Replace**: Create a better version before deleting
- **Disable**: Temporarily disable instead of deleting

## Deletion Scenarios

### Outdated Content

When questions become outdated:

- **Technology Changes**: Framework or language updates
- **Best Practice Evolution**: Industry standard changes
- **Deprecated Features**: Features no longer in use
- **Version Updates**: Major version changes

### Quality Issues

When questions have quality problems:

- **Ambiguous Language**: Unclear or confusing questions
- **Incorrect Answers**: Wrong answers marked as correct
- **Poor Distractors**: Obviously wrong answer options
- **Insufficient Coverage**: Questions that don't test intended skills

### Redundancy

When questions are redundant:

- **Duplicate Content**: Similar questions testing same concept
- **Overlapping Skills**: Questions covering same skill area
- **Better Alternatives**: Superior questions available
- **Assessment Balance**: Too many questions on one topic

## Best Practices

- **Usage Analysis**: Check how often questions are used
