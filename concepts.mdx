## Overview

This guide introduces the core concepts and terminology used throughout Skillment. Understanding these concepts will help you navigate the platform more effectively and make the most of its features.

## Core Entities

### Organizations

Organizations are the top-level entity in Skillment's multi-tenant architecture. Each organization represents a company, institution, or group that conducts assessments.

```json Organization Structure
{
  "id": "org_abc123",
  "name": "acme-corp",
  "displayName": "ACME Corporation",
  "type": "corporate",
  "plan": "elite",
  "users": ["user1", "user2"],
  "assessments": ["assessment1", "assessment2"]
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Custom branding and logos
- Subscription management
- Team member access control
- Isolated data and settings

### Users

Users are individuals who belong to an organization and can create, manage, or participate in assessments.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="crown">
    Full access to all organization features including billing and team management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member" icon="user">
    Can create assessments and manage candidates with standard permissions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    Read-only access to assessments and analytics without modification rights
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Assessments

Assessments are the primary evaluation tools in Skillment. They contain questions, configuration settings, and define the testing experience.

```json Assessment Components
{
  "basicInfo": {
    "title": "Frontend Developer Assessment",
    "description": "React and JavaScript evaluation",
    "duration": 60,
    "totalMarks": 100
  },
  "settings": {
    "randomizeQuestions": true,
    "showResults": true,
    "attemptLimit": 1
  },
  "security": {
    "proctoring": true,
    "fullScreen": true,
    "tabSwitchDetection": true
  }
}
```

**Assessment Types:**
- **Technical**: Programming, coding challenges, system design
- **Academic**: Subject-specific knowledge, standardized tests
- **Behavioral**: Personality assessments, cultural fit evaluations
- **Certification**: Professional certifications, compliance testing

### Questions

Questions are the building blocks of assessments. Skillment supports various question types to accommodate different evaluation needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Multiple Choice">
    ```json MCQ Structure
    {
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is React?",
      "options": [
        "A JavaScript library",
        "A database",
        "A server framework",
        "An operating system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "marks": 5
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Coding">
    ```json Coding Question
    {
      "type": "coding",
      "question": "Implement a function to reverse a string",
      "language": "javascript",
      "testCases": [
        {"input": "hello", "output": "olleh"},
        {"input": "world", "output": "dlrow"}
      ],
      "marks": 20
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Essay">

### Candidates

Candidates are individuals who take assessments. They can be invited by assessment creators and receive unique credentials for accessing evaluations.

```json Candidate Lifecycle
{
  "invitation": {
    "status": "invited",
    "sentAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "assessment": {
    "status": "in_progress",
    "startedAt": "2024-01-01T14:30:00Z",
    "timeSpent": 1800
  },

    "status": "completed",
    "submittedAt": "2024-01-01T15:30:00Z",
    "score": 85
  }
}
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Proctoring

Proctoring is Skillment's comprehensive security and monitoring system that ensures assessment integrity.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Proctoring">
    - **Webcam Monitoring**: Record candidate during assessment
    - **Tab Switch Detection**: Monitor when candidates leave the assessment tab
    - **Full Screen Mode**: Force assessment to run in full screen
    - **Right Click Disable**: Prevent context menu access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced Proctoring">
    - **Screen Recording**: Capture entire screen activity
    - **Environment Check**: Verify assessment environment
    - **ID Verification**: Confirm candidate identity
    - **Copy-Paste Detection**: Monitor clipboard activities
    - **Suspicious Activity Detection**: AI-powered behavior analysis
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Analytics

Skillment provides comprehensive analytics at multiple levels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Assessment Analytics" icon="chart-bar">
    Overall assessment performance, completion rates, and score distributions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Question Analytics" icon="chart-line">

### Team Management

Team management enables collaborative assessment creation and administration within organizations.

```json Team Structure
{
  "teamMember": {
    "email": "member@example.com",
    "role": "member",
    "permissions": {
      "assessments": ["read", "create", "edit"],
      "candidates": ["read", "invite"],
      "analytics": ["read"],
      "team": ["read"]
    },
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

## Security Model

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

Each organization's data is completely isolated:

```javascript Security Boundaries
{
  "organization": "org_abc",
  "data_access": {
    "assessments": "org_abc_assessments_only",
    "candidates": "org_abc_candidates_only",
    "analytics": "org_abc_data_only",
    "team": "org_abc_members_only"
  },
  "cross_tenant_access": "forbidden"
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Permissions are enforced at every level:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Resource Level">
    ```json Resource Permissions
    {
      "assessment_123": {
        "owner": "user_abc",
        "collaborators": ["user_def", "user_ghi"],
        "permissions": {
          "read": ["owner", "collaborators", "admin"],
          "edit": ["owner", "admin"],
          "delete": ["owner", "admin"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Organization Level">
    ```json Organization Permissions
    {
      "organization": "org_abc",
      "admin_permissions": ["all"],
      "member_permissions": [
        "assessments.create",
        "assessments.read_own",
        "candidates.invite"
      ],
      "viewer_permissions": [
        "assessments.read",
        "analytics.read"
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integration Patterns

### API-First Design

Skillment follows an API-first approach where every feature is accessible via REST APIs:

```javascript API Integration Pattern
// Create assessment via API
const assessment = await skillment.assessments.create({
  title: "Technical Interview",
  questions: questionIds,
  settings: {
    duration: 90,
    proctoring: true
  }
});

// Invite candidates programmatically
await skillment.candidates.invite({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  candidates: candidateList,
  emailTemplate: "technical_interview"
});
```

### Webhook Support

Real-time updates through webhooks:

```json Webhook Events
{
  "assessment.completed": {
    "candidateId": "candidate_123",
    "assessmentId": "assessment_456",
    "score": 85,
    "completedAt": "2024-01-01T15:30:00Z"
  },
  "proctoring.alert": {
    "candidateId": "candidate_123",
    "type": "tab_switch",
    "severity": "medium",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T14:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Question Variety" icon="shuffle">
    Mix different question types to evaluate various skills comprehensively
  </Card>
  <Card title="Balanced Difficulty" icon="balance-scale">
    Include questions of varying difficulty levels to properly differentiate candidates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clear Instructions" icon="message-square">
    Provide clear, unambiguous instructions for each question and section
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time Management" icon="clock">
    Allocate appropriate time based on question complexity and candidate level
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Security Configuration

1. **Enable Appropriate Proctoring**: Match security level to assessment importance
2. **Test Environment**: Verify all security features work in candidate environments
3. **Clear Communication**: Inform candidates about security requirements beforehand
4. **Backup Plans**: Have alternative assessment methods for technical issues

### Team Collaboration

- **Role Assignment**: Give team members appropriate permissions for their responsibilities
- **Communication**: Establish clear workflows for assessment creation and review
- **Quality Control**: Implement review processes for questions and assessments
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of assessment standards and procedures
