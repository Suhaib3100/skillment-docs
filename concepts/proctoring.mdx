# Proctoring

Proctoring is a comprehensive monitoring system that ensures assessment integrity by preventing cheating and maintaining academic honesty during online assessments.

## What is Proctoring?

Proctoring in Skillment includes:

- **Screen Recording**: Captures candidate's screen activity
- **Webcam Monitoring**: Video surveillance during assessment
- **Browser Lock**: Prevents switching tabs or applications
- **Behavior Analysis**: AI-powered suspicious activity detection
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logs of assessment sessions

## Proctoring Features

    "storage_duration": "30_days"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
