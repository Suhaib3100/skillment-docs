# Assessments

Assessments are the core component of Skillment's evaluation system. They allow you to create comprehensive tests for candidates with various question types, proctoring features, and detailed analytics.

## What is an Assessment?

An assessment is a structured evaluation that consists of:

- **Questions**: Multiple choice, coding, essay, or file upload questions
- **Configuration**: Time limits, randomization, proctoring settings
- **Participants**: Candidates who will take the assessment
- **Results**: Detailed analytics and performance metrics

## Assessment Types

### 1. Multiple Choice Assessments
Traditional question-based assessments with predefined answers.

```json
{
  "type": "multiple_choice",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the capital of France?",
      "options": ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
      "correct_answer": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Coding Assessments
Programming challenges with code execution and evaluation.

```json
{
  "type": "coding",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Write a function to reverse a string",
      "language": "python",
      "test_cases": [
        {
          "input": "hello",
          "expected_output": "olleh"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Mixed Assessments
Combinations of different question types in a single assessment.

## Assessment Configuration

- **Webcam Monitoring**: Video surveillance during assessment
- **Browser Lock**: Prevent switching tabs/windows
- **Copy-Paste Prevention**: Disable clipboard access

## Assessment Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Set up questions and configuration
2. **Invitation**: Send assessment links to candidates
3. **Execution**: Candidates take the assessment
4. **Evaluation**: Automatic or manual grading
5. **Analysis**: Review results and analytics

## Best Practices

### Question Design
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Include appropriate time limits
- Test questions before deployment
- Provide detailed instructions

### Security
- Enable proctoring for high-stakes assessments
- Use randomization to prevent cheating
- Set appropriate time limits
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### User Experience
- Provide clear instructions
- Include practice questions
- Offer technical support
- Give detailed feedback

## API Integration

Create assessments programmatically using our REST API:

```bash
POST /api/assessments
{
  "title": "Frontend Developer Assessment",
  "description": "Test your React and JavaScript skills",
  "duration": 120,
  "questions": [...],
  "proctoring": {
    "screen_recording": true,
    "webcam_monitoring": true
  }
}
```
